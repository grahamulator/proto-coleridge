<p>Trusted networks are crucial to navigating complex topics and getting the most out of any analysis or research output. By maintaining the below network and community building options we hope to further the discourse between groups and promote the best possible outcomes in data analysis projects and efforts.</p>

<!-- Discussion -->
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>We maintain a <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> team as one method of communication for our Applied Data Analytics program. We include channels for programming specific issues (eg Python and SQL), training program specific topics, and general discussion. If you are interested in joining please <a href="mailto:admin@coleridgeinitiative.org?subject=Request%20to%20join%20ada-course%20Slack">send us an email</a> describing your background, how you can contribute to the discussion, and why you want to join.</p>

<!-- Journal-->
<h3>Online Journal</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate sharing best-practices and who is working on what topics, we are planning to maintain an online publication platform. If you have an article or other research product you would like posted as part of our first publication please <a href="mailto:admin@coleridgeinitiative.org?subject=Journal%20submission">send us an email</a> with your article and any supporting documents; note that we will only include clearly written documents which can be reasonably evaluated for validity.</p>
