<p>We believe that robust, peer reviewed research is a key ingredient in determining what factors improve society.</p>
<p>While each of the directors has their speciality (see sites for <a href="http://www.rayidghani.com/projects" target="_blank">Rayid</a>, <a href="https://www.popcenter.umd.edu/mprc-associates/fkreuter" target="_blank">Frauke</a>, and <a href="http://www.julialane.org/?page_id=9" target="_blank">Julia</a>), many of the team members also have their own diverse areas of research expertise; for example, much of Dani's work focuses on data privacy &amp confidentiality (see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VmqkJikAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">her Google scholar profile</a>).</p>
