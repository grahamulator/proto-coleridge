  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are a diverse group of data scientists, economists, statisticians, software engineers, and more with a strong desire to make the world a better place. We believe there is an opportunity to substantially improve how data is used and analyzed, especially in the context of public policy. </p>
  <h3>What we value</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Positive social impact</b>: Our every project, action, and effort contributes positive social value either directly or indirectly by supporting some <i>other</i> project, action, or effort</li>
      <li><b>Integrity &amp openness</b>: We do not sell anything we would not ourselves buy; every project requires clear benefits and justification</li>
      <li><b>Practical &amp robust progress</b>: We do not sacrifice science for expedience, nor pragmatism for science; every effort is explicitly scoped and continually reassessed</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The Colerdige Initiative is the culmination of many years of work by the three principal Directors: Rayid Ghani, Frauke Kreuter, and Julia Lane. A key turning point was teaching the courses that then lead to their publishing, in collaboration with key co-authors, the book <a href="bigdatasocialscience.com" target="_blank">Big Data and Social Science</a>.</p><br>
