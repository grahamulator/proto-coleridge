title: ADRF
description: "The Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) provides a secure platform to host confidential micro-dat.  The ADRF system has been granted FedRAMP moderate pre-authorization and is designed to scale to different amounts and types of use. The ADRF is not just a single configuration of computing resources.  Rather, it is provides a set of data analysis components that can be combined in different ways, within the secure ADRF boundary, to meet a wide range of analytical needs, from traditional statistical analysis of tabular data to configurations that could be used to combine tabular data and data of other types for analysis with diverse, state-of-the-art tools including large-scale map-reduce processing, GPU-intensive compute, and machine- and deep-learning.  This technical flexibility, combined with our user, project, and data set management tools, allow for a given instance of the ADRF to securely and nimbly serve diverse data, analytical, and security needs."

    <h3>De-identification services</h3>
    <p>The ADRF has developed a library of re-usable programs that implement hashing algorithms and salting strategies that can be used to consistently hash value across data sets for de-identified comparison.   We also have validated processes for project-based secure storage and reuse of salts and keys used to hash across data sets.  We build a secure hashing module to the suite of tools provided to each project to support relating de-identified data sets.</p>


    <h3>Standardized metadata</h3>
    <p>In conceptualizing a data model for describing datasets, we have opted for a minimal set of fields that can be used to describe the broadest number of datasets, irrespective of their original domain. This data model pulls largely from accepted metadata standards such as Dublin Core, the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), and the Project Open Data Metadata Schema. This provides a transparent and flexible method for describing datasets and facilitates their discoverability across domains and research uses. We also make use of the ICPSR Subject Thesaurus to plug into an existing vocabulary for describing administrative and social science datasets. Metadata fields include joining datasets in search by tags, topical categories, geo-spatial dimensions, temporal dimensions, and policy specifications (stipulations around access and terms of use, for example). This metadata schema is not tied to a specific domain and so is flexible, thus the core set of metadata fields can be expanded and adapted to the evolving data consumption needs of our users.</p>


    <h3>Flexible search</h3>
    <p>We also employ a flexible taxonomy for the first class entities (people, datasets, projects, research products, and tools) in the ADRF to integrate them for subsequent search and discovery. Categories that can be used to further describe entities include: (i) People (ii) Methods - analytical, statistical, research, etc., (iii) Topics, subjects and keywords, and (iv) Data sets. The ADRF Explorer enables users to search across the different content types. The Explorer is indexed via the AWS ElasticSearch service, which joins these metadata elements across entities to enable federated search.</p>


    <h3>Automated Data Stewardship</h3>
    <p>The Data Stewardship module provides dataset management to ADRF. It is a single-page web application in development that will provide a more intuitive interface for automating workflows. As with all other parts of ADRF, the Data Stewardship module is compliant with all FedRAMP controls. Its main users are Data Providers, Data Stewards and DF Staff responsible for data management. Data Stewards are internal ADRF users empowered by the Data Providers to grant access and moderate metadata related to the datasets. This role facilitates the management of the data usage inside ADRF as it reduces the time to grant access to the data without compromising control.</p>
    <p>The module controls who has access to which data and what ADRF content is related to that data. These functions are essential in that they provide controls while also enabling straightforward answers to critical questions such as “which projects use my data?” or “how is my data being used and which byproducts were generated by whom?”</p>
    <p>The Data Stewardship module facilitates the data access approval process, reducing time and improving resource utilization, as it provides automated and rich workflows to support the data access request and approval process, user-generated metadata moderation, data access control, and reporting. The main features are the (i) management of dataset policies and data stewards, (ii) management of data access requests and approval workflows (iii) the management of user generated metadata approval workflow and (iv) reporting on dataset usage, listing projects, user generated metadata.</p>
