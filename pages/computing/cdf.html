description: "The CUSP Data Facility (CDF) at New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) connects users to relevant datasets for urban policy research. It reduces the multiple technical, legal, bureaucratic, capacity, and cost barriers to data access, in a secure environment so that the full benefits of data use can be realized."

    <h3>Safe people</h3>
    <p>We work to ensure that all researchers accessing the data are trained to respect privacy and confidentiality. We do this through training and legal agreements. We provide yearly trainings on “Data Privacy &amp; Confidentiality” and “Responsible Data Use” that all Data Facility users must either attend in-person seminars or review the online videos. Data Facility users must also review and agree to the current terms of use on a yearly basis. Additionally, we encourage all researchers who are working with yellow or red data to review on a yearly basis the American Statistical Association’s Training Modules on Privacy and Confidentiality.</p>

    <h3>Safe projects</h3>
    <p>We have a data governance structure in place to ensure that projects are safe. CUSP data assets are classified as green, yellow, and red, as a simple but effective method for describing the way in which researchers can access and work with datasets. All CUSP datasets are discoverable on the Data Catalog but researcher access to nonpublic datasets (yellow and red) is subject to internal review and must be associated with a research project proposal. The data steward reviews the proposal and grants access.</p>


    <h3>Safe settings</h3>
    <p>The data are housed in a safe setting. CUSP maintains confidential data in a secure data environment with encrypted data ingress protocols, data storage in a secure data server, group management control at the data file level, and restricted export of any data products. Researchers working with sensitive data may access that data through remote access or through CUSP-certified machines on the LAN. CUSP works closely with NYU’s Information Technology security and data architecture experts to ensure the system adheres to modern best practices in secure data management.</p>


    <h3>Safe outputs</h3>
    <p>Confidential output is reviewed prior to release. Data products generated from yellow or red data are subject to internal review to limit any potential reidentification of individuals or entities. Of course, researchers working with green data in the CUSP Data Facility may freely export data products for research, collaboration, and publication. The Data Facility data export guidelines are published on the Data Hub.</p>
