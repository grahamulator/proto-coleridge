    <h3>ADRF<br><small> Administrative Data Research Facility</small></h3>
    <p>The Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) provides a secure platform to host confidential micro-dat.  The ADRF system has been granted FedRAMP moderate pre-authorization and is designed to scale to different amounts and types of use. The ADRF is not just a single configuration of computing resources.  Rather, it is provides a set of data analysis components that can be combined in different ways, within the secure ADRF boundary, to meet a wide range of analytical needs, from traditional statistical analysis of tabular data to configurations that could be used to combine tabular data and data of other types for analysis with diverse, state-of-the-art tools including large-scale map-reduce processing, GPU-intensive compute, and machine- and deep-learning.  This technical flexibility, combined with our user, project, and data set management tools, allow for a given instance of the ADRF to securely and nimbly serve diverse data, analytical, and security needs.</p>
